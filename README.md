<h1>bevy-terminal-renderer</h1>

This project is a terminal renderer for the amazing [bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/). It allows you render your games/simulations using a terminal. Why would anybody do this? Well, I wanted to get more familiar with bevy and I like the terminal, so why not. This is a small hobby project of mine, and will not be actively maintained.

> **Note**: This has only been tested on Linux!
